## Worksheet Week 5

**Date**: 25/Feb/25
 
**Topic**: Sockets Programming

**Objective**: Explore the use of sockets in a basic client - server solution.

### Overview

Socket programming forms the backbone of IoT system development by enabling the critical device-to-device and device-to-server communications that define connected ecosystems. As the fundamental mechanism for establishing network connections, sockets provide the standardized interfaces through which IoT devices transmit sensor data, receive commands, and coordinate activities across distributed systems. Their lightweight nature makes them ideal for resource-constrained IoT devices, while their flexibility supports various protocols at application level that are essential for different IoT use cases.

In this worksheet you will use sockets to communicate a simple client-server application.
