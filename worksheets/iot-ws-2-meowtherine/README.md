## Worksheet 2

**Date**: 04/Feb/25
 
**Topic**: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

**Objective**: Simulate sensor operation using HAL.

### Overview

IoT systems involve interfacing with a variety of sensors and actuators. HAL provides a standardized interface between software and hardware, enabling developers to write code that can easily adapt to different sensor types or hardware platforms. This facilitates prototyping and testing of IoT solutions.

In this worksheet you will explore how a simple HAL can be implemented and create a simulated Temperature sensor that will read synthetic data from CSV file. Finally, you will write the unit tests for your simulated sensor. 

### Activities
